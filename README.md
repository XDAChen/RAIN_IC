# RAIN_IC
 Yasra, Jeremy
 
 Configured the pins for the RAIN IC.
 
 list of things we need to complete for this code:
 1: finish  defining coressponding register addresses and its value 
 2: transmit the settings above using HAL_SPI_Transmit Api
 3: Interrupt handling
 4: RF Switches hadnling
 finshing above will set up and read the IC
 
 3: synchoniztion mechanism: i have the idea but i need to update you about this
 4: how to visualize data output: need to be discussed
 
 Yasra, now we have the skeleton code, it is a good time split up the work. I will talk to you about this tommrow
 
 Thanks
 Chen
